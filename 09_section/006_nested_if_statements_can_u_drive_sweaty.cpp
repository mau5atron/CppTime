    In this exercise you will use nested 'if' statements to decide if someone
    can drive.

    Let's assume that anyone 16 or older can legally drive, but they must also 
    'own a car to drive'

    If the person is not 16 or older then you should display, "Sorry, come back
    in 'n' years and be sure you own a car when you come back." , where n is how
    many years until the person turns 16 years old 

    If the person is  16 or older but they do NOT own a car, then your program
    should display, "Sorry, you need to buy a car before you can drive!".

    If the person is 16 or older and they DO own a car, then your program
    shoujld display, "Yes, you can drive!".

    NOTE
    The 'age' will be provided for you, you do NOT need to declare 'age'. We
    will also automatically provide a boolean variable named 'has_car' which
    will be "true" if the person owns a car or 'false' otherwise. Our test cases
    will provide different values for 'age' and 'has_car' to test your code. 

    Please do NOT provide "\n" or 'endl' in your display statements.
