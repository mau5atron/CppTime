  MF Exercise ðŸ˜¤

  Given a vector of integers, determine how many integers are present before you
  see the value -99. Note, it is possible -99 is 'not' in the vector! If -99 is
  'not' in the vector, then the result will be equal to the number of elements
  in the vector. 

  The final result should be stored in an integer variable named count.

  Note that the different vectors will be tested against your code. You do not
  need to declare the vector of integers. 'vec' is the name of the vector you
  should use.
