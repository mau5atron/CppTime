/*
  I/O and Streams - Section 19 Challenge 3: Word finder

    - Ask the user to enter a word
    - Process the Romeo and Juliet file and determine how many totla words there
      are and how many times the word the user entered appears as a substring of
      a word in the play.

    - For example if the user enters "love" then the words "love", "lovely", and
      "beloved" will all be considered matches
    - You decide whether you want to be case sensitive or not.
    - Some sample runs:
      - Enter the substring to search for "love"
      - 25919 words were searched...
      - The substring love was found 171 times

  skipping this.....
