  Smart Pointers:

    Issues with raw pointers

    - C++ provides absolute flexibility with memory management
      - Allocation
      - Deallocation
      - Lifetime management
    - Some potentially serious problems
      - Uninitialized (wile) pointers
      - Memory leaks
      - Dangling pointers
      - Not exception safe
    - Ownership?
      - Who knows the pointer
      - When should a pointer be deleted
