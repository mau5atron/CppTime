/*
  Multiple Inheritance:

    - A derived class inherits from two or more Base classes at the same time
    - The Base classes may belong to unrelated class hierarchies
    - A Department Chair
      - Is-A Faculty and
      - Is-A Administrator

  Multiple Inheritance C++ syntax:

    class Department_Chair : public Faculty, public Administrator
    {
      ...
    };

    - Beyond the scope of this course
    - Some compelling use-cases
    - Easily misused
    - Can be very complex
