    34 // literal

    fav_num // variable

    1.5 + 2.8 // addition

    a = b // assignment
  */ 

  // Difference between Expression and statement

      declaration, jump, try blocks, and others.


    int x; // declaration 
    favourite_num = 12; // assignment 
    1.5 + 2.8; // expression
    x = 2 * 5; // assignment 
    if(a > b) cout << "a is greater than b"; // if
