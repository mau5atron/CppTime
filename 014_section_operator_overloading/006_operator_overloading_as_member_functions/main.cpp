/*
  Quiz: Operator Overloading as Member Functions:

    - Given the provided money class, please add the equality operators == and
      != 
    - These overloaded operators should return a bool if both the dollars and
      cents attributes are the same for both objects

    - First, add the overloaded operator function declarations to the Money
      class declaration in Money.h
    - Second, add the overloaded operator function definitions in Money.cpp
    - These overloadded functions should not modify the objects in any way
